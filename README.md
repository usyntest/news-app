# About The Project

---

This is a simple news app made with react which consumes the newsAPI.

### Tools used

**1. Tailwind CSS** (This is the best thing I have used in a while, I didn't had to leave my js file once its the perfect replacement for CSS)

**2. Axios** (For fetching API)

**3. React-Router-Dom** (For routing)

i deployed the project at usyntest-news-app.netlify.app bit its not working the server is returning a status code of 426, and i'm too lazy to fix it. JUST READ THE CODE

__EDIT__: _Newsapi changed their pricing model._
_You can't make requests from the browser anymore, you'll have to use a backend. I had the same problem and the easiest way around it was implementing a Node (Express) server._
