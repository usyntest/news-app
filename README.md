# About The Project

---

This is a simple news app made with react which consumes the newsAPI.

### Tools used

**1. Tailwind CSS** (This is the best thing I have used in a while, I didn't had to leave my js file once its the perfect replacement for CSS)

**2. Axios** (For fetching API)

**3. React-Router-Dom** (For routing)
